                This is a one-month workshop with 12 contact sessions of 90
                minutes each. There will be a maximum of 12 students in a batch,
                and only one batches a week. Thus, there are only 24 available
                seats.

                The workshop will use a Group Discussion cum Group Interview
                format, which was introduced by IIM Bangalore, among others,
                many years ago. Participants will get the opportunity to improve
                their oral presentation skills and learn from the other members
                in the group. This exposure will be invaluable for competitive
                entrance exams and career interviews.
