          <u>Workshop on Professional Career Enhancement Skills</u>
        </h3>
        <div id="workshop_info">
          <p>
            This is a one-month workshop with 12 contact sessions of 90 minutes
            each. There will be a maximum of 12 students in a batch, and only
            a batch a week. Thus, there are only 24 available seats.
          </p>

          <p>
            The workshop will use a Group Discussion cum Group Interview format,
            which was introduced by IIM Bangalore, among others, many years ago.
            Participants will get the opportunity to improve their oral
            presentation skills and learn from the other members in the group.
            This exposure will be invaluable for competitive entrance exams and
            career interviews.
